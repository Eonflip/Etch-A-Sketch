<h1>Etch-A-Sketch</h1>

<p>This is a simple etch-a-sketch project that I created alongside the curriculum for The Odin Project, it was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>Some learnings I took away from this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
  <li>Event Listeners</li>
  <li>Flexbox</li>
  <li>Color Input as an HTML element</li>
  <li>Range Selection as an HTML element</li>
</ul>
<p>The code may not be perfectly optimized but I plan to revisit this project as a map for how much I've learned and how far I've come, I hope that you enjoy :)</p>
